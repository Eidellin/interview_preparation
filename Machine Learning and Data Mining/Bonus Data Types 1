# Data Types

## In the Machine Learning world, in general, two types of data are defined:

### Numerical:
Anything represented by numbers (e.g., integer, floating point)

### Categorical:
everything that is not numerical (e.g. discrete labeled groups)

#### In general, for machine learning algorithms, **data has to be represented in numeric form**

### Another Taxonomy of data types:
#### 1. Irrelevant
it might be represented with strings or numbers but has no relationship with the outcome (e.g. participants or code)
#### 2. Nominal
discrete values with no numerical relationship between different categories (e.g. animal types, colors, nationality)
#### 3. Binary
discrete data with only two possibilities (e.g cancerous vs. non-cancerous)
#### 4. Ordinal
discrete integers that can be ranked, but the relative distance between any two numbers can not be defined (e.g., students rank based on GPA)
#### 5. Count
discrete whole numbers without any negatives
#### 6. Time
a cyclical, repeating continuous form of data (e.g days, weeks)
#### 7. Interval
data that we can measure the distance between different values. (e.g., temperature, income)
